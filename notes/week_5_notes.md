# Week 5 Preview Notes
## Matchup: Ho Chi Win City vs Sweaty Slammers

> Big time showdown between storied rivals. Sweaty Slammers carries wilted roses into this one, having gotten the best of Ho Chi Win City for the past two years, albeit having only met on those two occasions. Here the first of (at least) two matchups of these juggarnauts this year.

## Matchup: Globo Gym vs Tess Finesse

> Same script, condensed into just one year and without the storied past, Tess Finesse is in need of some momentum to begin climbing back toward the upper half.    

---
## Matchup: Blue's Balls vs Dusty’s Dingleberries

> GOTW: In an alternate universe this year, these two teams are nearly flipped! Dusty (5th, 2-2, 505 PF) and Jasper (8th, 1-3, 519 PF). It's not exactly that Blue's Balls has been bad; rather, they've been exceptionally good at scoring just enough to win. All three of their wins were good for the lowest winnning score accolade (3/4 on offer).  But top of mind has to be that Blue's Balls is out to avenge a L5 that amounts to having never bested Dusty's squad.

## Matchup: Gl Hf (you’re gay) vs Devil Jelq with Me

> Another good one, Mike on a W3 toward leveling this OG rivalry.

---
## Matchup: No I’m gonna win UR gay vs Rip Glizzy #1

> And finally, RJ (0-4) looking for that first W, projected to score in the upper half as it stands, but may have to do so without their star TE and against a poised and hungry Bo squad.
